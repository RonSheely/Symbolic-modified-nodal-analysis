Backup History

| filename        | description |
|:----------------|:------------|
| node analysis_8-18-2017.ipynb | Starting file, generated from my old c code.  I didn’t complete the translation and I changed the  approach.  I'm now going to implement Modified Nodal Analysis solution. | 
| node analysis_8-19-2017.ipynb | This backup contains a mix of numpy and sympy code.  Probably will go symbolic, so this backup has the numpy code up to that point. | 
| node analysis_9-1-2017.ipynb | This backup has some code clean up.  I added op amps, but I have not debugged the code yet.  I moved to the comments and text to their own mark down cells for eas of reading and to make the notebook look better. |
