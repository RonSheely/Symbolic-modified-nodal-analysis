## Validation Test Circuits  
Last updated: 14 Nov 2023

This folder contains the test circuits used to validate the network analysis code.   

Basic validation of the code consisted of analyzing simple networks and examining the results. A more comprehensive evaluation of the code was performed by solving test circuits and comparing the results to LTSpice. As of October 2023 all the element types have been tested. The validation circuits range from simple to large and complex. The largest validation circuit consist of 32 nodes, 59 branches and multiple instances all of the element types. For this large test circuit, there are small numerical differences between the Python MNA code results and the LTSpice solution, which are describe in the JupyterLab notebooks.

The table below lists the test circuits used to validate and test the code. Each test circuit has itâ€™s own folder with the support files. The test circuits are a collection of problems from text books or large and complex circuits that I made up that include various elements or unique combinations of elements or topologies. In LTSpice the series resistance for inductors defaults to 1e-3 Ohms unless set to zero. Leaving the default series inductance at 1e-3 Ohms will cause small numerical differences in the solution obtained by LTSpice.
